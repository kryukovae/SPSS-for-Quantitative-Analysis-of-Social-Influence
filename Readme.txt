Emotional Intelligence as a measurable driver of individual social influence
Done by Ekaterina Kryukova

Modern customers tend to ignore traditional advertising media.
However, they still listen to their friends, colleagues and relatives. But who of them is really influential and how to measure this influence?
The empirical part of my master thesis explored influence apart of product expertise. 
I quantitatively compared the performance of an Opinion leadership scale and an Emotional Intelligence scale in identifying influencers.

To test whom people tend to ask for advice I designed a game and run an experiment. 

Surprisingly, despite the absence of experts in 81% of cases respondents read an advice of a colleague, in 34% of cases they changed their opinion.
My next step was to define if these influentials had higher scores on emotional intelligence scale.
I run binary logistic regression and Poisson regression in SPSS to analyse data. The results demonstrated that the Emotional Intelligence scale outperforms the Opinion Leadership scale in identifying influential. 
Thereby, to influence others one should not necessarily be better informed about a subject. Informational influence may exist independently on expert knowledge.
